1. **HW1 Calculator 1.0** - This contains the basic implementation of the calculator compiler.  It contains three programs, one for evaluating the expression, another for writing it in post fix notation and a final to write it as an s-expression.

2. **HW2 Calculator 2.0** - This expands upon the basic compiler introducing types and boolean expressions.  This implementation also includes a lexer, because symbols are no longer only one character long.  It contains one program to evaluate expressions.
